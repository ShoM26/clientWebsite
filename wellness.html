            <h1>Salt Therapy</h1>
            <p>Dry salt therapy is breathing in micro-sized salt particles immediately transported to every part of the respiratory tract. Salt molecules dissolve and attract small impurities, helping inflammation in the airways and on the skin. Salth therapy will promote a healthy respiratory environment, reduce illnesses, allergies, bronchitis, asthma and skin conditions. Chronic issues will benefit from 3-4 times/week and then tapering off to weekly sessions.</p>
            <h1>Red Light Therapy</h1>
            <p>Red light therapy is thought to work by acting on the “power house” in your body’s cells called mitochondria. With more energy, other cells can do their work more efficiently, such as repairing skin, boosting new cell growth, and enhancing skin rejuvenation. More specifically, certain cells absorb light wavelengths and are stimulated to work.
                Red Light Therapy combines powerful red light and near-infrared wavelengths to offer you an effective theraputic experience proven to reduce oxidative stress and stimulating the production of ATP (Adenosin Triphosphate) through a process known as biomodulation. <br>
            Other benefits include reduction of chronic and acute pain, skin rejuvination through collagen and elastin production. reduces inflammation, helps boosts immune system, improves sleep, enhances brain function, and boosts testosterone production <br>
